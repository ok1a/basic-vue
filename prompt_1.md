# Vue bootstrap Project Prompt

We would like you to create a new Vue project with some basic routable views.

## Project top level Requirements

- This does not have to be deployed on the internet
- No back end is required
- `npm run serve` should start a local server where we can view the end result in browser
- Please do this work in a repository
  - Does not have to be public, but we will want access to the repo and not just the final code
  - This is your best opportunity to communicate your building process as it evolves so please make lots of commits and give descriptive commit messages

## Vue Application Requirements

- Must route to two pages
  - Use any routing library you choose
  - Required pages
    - /home
    - /news
- Page Header that shows up on every page
  - This just needs to have a text title. Don't spend time on the design.
- Both pages must display a button that has some non-default text formatting
  - Example: Bold red font. But as long as you apply some CSS then the requirement is satisfied
  - When you click the button, a message is logged to the console that includes the page you are on

## Evaluation

- Structure and clean code is more important than polished looking pages
- Code Structure follows Vue conventions
- Tooling and bootstrapped serve process is successful and starts the page

## Available tools

Feel free to use anything you can find on the internet:

- Tutorials
- Vue / Framework Documentation
- CLI / code tools to bootstrap
  - Either from Vue directly or from third parties

## Other general requests

- If you have spent more than 2 hours and have not made substantive progress then please reach out
  - This should take you no more than 4 or 5 hours in total so if progress isn't happening, then please reach out
- Please reference the tools / tutorials you used
  - This just means a top level bibliography with a list of links.
- Please commit early and often.
  - Again, this is the best way for us to see how and why you made the decisions you made.
